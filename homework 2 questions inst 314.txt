1) What is the size of the dataset? (how many datapoints do we have?)

2) What is the mean of this column?

3) What is the standard deviation?

4) What is the maximum value?

5) What is the minimum value?

 

Calculate the standard scores (also called z-scores) of this column and find:

6) What is the z-score of the largest value?

7) What is the z-score of the smallest value?

 

Now we investigate the distribution:

8) How many datapoints are within one standard deviation away from the mean? (that is, how many datapoints are less than mean + sd and greater than mean - sd?

9) What proportion of the datapoints are within one standard deviation away from the mean?

10) What proportion of the datapoints are within two standard deviations away from the mean?

 

 

 

Now let's work on the "Humidity(%)" column:

 

11) What proportion of the datapoints are within one standard deviation away from the mean?

12) What proportion of the datapoints are within two standard deviations away from the mean?
